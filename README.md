Project Title: Face Recognition Attendance System

Description: The Face Recognition Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to automate and streamline the process of recording attendance in educational institutions. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, this system detects and recognizes students' faces as they enter the classroom, automatically marking their attendance and updating records in real-time.

Key Features:

Automated Attendance: Detects and recognizes student faces to mark attendance, eliminating the need for manual input.
Proxy Prevention: Ensures only the recognized individual can be marked present, reducing instances of proxy attendance.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple GUI with options to register students, delete records, train the model, and mark attendance.
Real-time Processing: Provides quick and accurate attendance marking, even under various conditions like different lighting and head movements.
Cost-Efficient: Designed to be a scalable and low-cost solution that integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure.
Technologies Used:

Computer Vision
Machine Learning
Python (with libraries such as OpenCV)
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
This project offers a practical application of modern AI and machine learning technologies, providing a robust and efficient alternative to traditional attendance systems. It's especially valuable in educational environments where maintaining accurate attendance records is critical.
